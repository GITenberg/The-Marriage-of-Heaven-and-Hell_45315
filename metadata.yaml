description: This vivid facsimile of Blake's romantic and revolutionary publication
  offers a concise expression of his essential wisdom and philosophy. The poet's conception
  of a cosmic union of the material world and physical desire has inspired artists
  and thinkers from Aldous Huxley to Jim Morrison. His distinctive hand-lettered text
  is accompanied by 27 color plates of his stirring illustrations.
