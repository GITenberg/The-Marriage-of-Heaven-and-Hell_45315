<p>As a new heaven is begun, and it is
now thirty-three years since its advent,
the Eternal Hell revives. And lo!
Swedenborg is the angel sitting at
the tomb: his writings are the linen
clothes folded up. Now is the dominion
of Edom, and the return of Adam
into Paradise.&mdash;See Isaiah <abbr title="34">xxxiv.</abbr> and
<abbr title="35">xxxv.</abbr> chap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Without contraries is no progression.
Attraction and repulsion, reason
and energy, love and hate, are
necessary to human existence.</p>

<p>From these contraries spring what
the religious call Good and Evil.
Good is the passive that obeys reason;
Evil is the active springing from
Energy.</p>

<p>Good is heaven. Evil is hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="THE_VOICE_OF_THE_DEVIL" id="THE_VOICE_OF_THE_DEVIL"></a>THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL</h2>


<p>All Bibles or sacred codes have been
the cause of the following errors:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That man has two real existing
principles, viz., a Body and a Soul.</p>

<p>2. That Energy, called Evil, is alone
from the Body; and that Reason, called
Good, is alone from the Soul.</p>

<p>3. That God will torment man in
Eternity for following his Energies.</p>

<p>But the following contraries to
these are true:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Man has no Body distinct from his
Soul. For that called Body is a portion
of Soul discerned by the five senses,
the chief inlets of Soul in this age.</p>

<p>2. Energy is the only life, and is from
the Body; and Reason is the bound
or outward circumference of Energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Energy is Eternal Delight.</p>

<p>Those who restrain desire, do so
because theirs is weak enough to be
restrained; and the restrainer or
reason usurps its place and governs
the unwilling.</p>

<p>And being restrained, it by degrees
becomes passive, till it is only the
shadow of desire.</p>

<p>The history of this is written in
Paradise Lost, and the Governor or
Reason is called Messiah.</p>

<p>And the original Archangel or possessor
of the command of the heavenly
host is called the Devil, or Satan, and
his children are called Sin and Death.</p>

<p>But in the book of Job, Milton&rsquo;s
Messiah is called Satan.</p>

<p>For this history has been adopted by
both parties.</p>

<p>It indeed appeared to Reason as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
desire was cast out, but the Devil&rsquo;s
account is, that the Messiah fell, and
formed a heaven of what he stole from
the abyss.</p>

<p>This is shown in the Gospel, where
he prays to the Father to send the
Comforter or desire that Reason may
have ideas to build on, the Jehovah
of the Bible being no other than he
who dwells in flaming fire. Know
that after Christ&rsquo;s death he became
Jehovah.</p>

<p>But in Milton, the Father is Destiny,
the Son a ratio of the five senses, and
the Holy Ghost vacuum!</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The reason Milton wrote
in fetters when he wrote of Angels
and God, and at liberty when of
Devils and Hell, is because he was
a true poet, and of the Devil&rsquo;s party
without knowing it.</p>

<h2><a name="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_1" id="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_1"></a>A MEMORABLE FANCY</h2>


<p>As I was walking among the fires
of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments
of Genius, which to Angels look like
torment and insanity, I collected some
of their proverbs, thinking that as the
sayings used in a nation mark its
character, so the proverbs of Hell show
the nature of infernal wisdom better
than any description of buildings or
garments.</p>

<p>When I came home, on the abyss
of the five senses, where a flat-sided
steep frowns over the present world, I
saw a mighty Devil folded in black
clouds hovering on the sides of the
rock; with corroding fires he wrote
the following sentence now perceived
by the minds of men, and read by
them on earth:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="PROVERBS_OF_HELL" id="PROVERBS_OF_HELL"></a>PROVERBS OF HELL</h2>


<p>In seed-time learn, in harvest teach,
in winter enjoy.</p>

<p>Drive your cart and your plough
over the bones of the dead.</p>

<p>The road of excess leads to the
palace of wisdom.</p>

<p>Prudence is a rich ugly old maid
courted by Incapacity.</p>

<p>He who desires, but acts not, breeds
pestilence.</p>

<p>The cut worm forgives the plough.</p>

<p>Dip him in the river who loves
water.</p>

<p>A fool sees not the same tree that a
wise man sees.</p>

<p>He whose face gives no light shall
never become a star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Eternity is in love with the productions
of time.</p>

<p>The busy bee has no time for sorrow.</p>

<p>The hours of folly are measured by
the clock, but of wisdom no clock can
measure.</p>

<p>All wholesome food is caught without
a net or a trap.</p>

<p>Bring out number, weight, and
measure in a year of dearth.</p>

<p>No bird soars too high if he soars
with his own wings.</p>

<p>A dead body revenges not injuries.</p>

<p>The most sublime act is to set another
before you.</p>

<p>If the fool would persist in his folly
he would become wise.</p>

<p>Folly is the cloak of knavery.</p>

<p>Shame is Pride&rsquo;s cloak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Prisons are built with stones of law,
brothels with bricks of religion.</p>

<p>The pride of the peacock is the
glory of God.</p>

<p>The lust of the goat is the bounty
of God.</p>

<p>The wrath of the lion is the wisdom
of God.</p>

<p>The nakedness of woman is the
work of God.</p>

<p>Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of
joy weeps.</p>

<p>The roaring of lions, the howling of
wolves, the raging of the stormy sea,
and the destructive sword, are portions
of Eternity too great for the eye
of man.</p>

<p>The fox condemns the trap, not
himself.</p>

<p>Joys impregnate, sorrows bring
forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Let man wear the fell of the lion,
woman the fleece of the sheep.</p>

<p>The bird a nest, the spider a web,
man friendship.</p>

<p>The selfish smiling fool and the
sullen frowning fool shall be both
thought wise that they may be a rod.</p>

<p>What is now proved was once only
imagined.</p>

<p>The rat, the mouse, the fox, the
rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the
tiger, the horse, the elephant watch
the fruits.</p>

<p>The cistern contains, the fountain
overflows.</p>

<p>One thought fills immensity.</p>

<p>Always be ready to speak your
mind, and a base man will avoid you.</p>

<p>Everything possible to be believed
is an image of truth.</p>

<p>The eagle never lost so much time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
as when he submitted to learn of the
crow.</p>

<p>The fox provides for himself, but
God provides for the lion.</p>

<p>Think in the morning, act in the
noon, eat in the evening, sleep in the
night.</p>

<p>He who has suffered you to impose
on him knows you.</p>

<p>As the plough follows words, so
God rewards prayers.</p>

<p>The tigers of wrath are wiser than
the horses of instruction.</p>

<p>Expect poison from the standing
water.</p>

<p>You never know what is enough
unless you know what is more than
enough.</p>

<p>Listen to the fool&rsquo;s reproach; it is a
kingly title.</p>

<p>The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the mouth of water, the beard of
earth.</p>

<p>The weak in courage is strong in
cunning.</p>

<p>The apple tree never asks the beech
how he shall grow, nor the lion the
horse how he shall take his prey.</p>

<p>The thankful receiver bears a plentiful
harvest.</p>

<p>If others had not been foolish we
should have been so.</p>

<p>The soul of sweet delight can never
be defiled.</p>

<p>When thou seest an eagle, thou
seest a portion of Genius. Lift up thy
head!</p>

<p>As the caterpillar chooses the fairest
leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest
lays his curse on the fairest joys.</p>

<p>To create a little flower is the labour
of ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Damn braces; bless relaxes.</p>

<p>The best wine is the oldest, the best
water the newest.</p>

<p>Prayers plough not; praises reap
not; joys laugh not; sorrows weep
not.</p>

<p>The head Sublime, the heart Pathos,
the genitals Beauty, the hands and
feet Proportion.</p>

<p>As the air to a bird, or the sea
to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible.</p>

<p>The crow wished everything was
black; the owl that everything was
white.</p>

<p>Exuberance is Beauty.</p>

<p>If the lion was advised by the fox,
he would be cunning.</p>

<p>Improvement makes straight roads,
but the crooked roads without Improvement
are roads of Genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Sooner murder an infant in its
cradle than nurse unacted desires.</p>

<p>Truth can never be told so as to be
understood and not to be believed.</p>

<p>Enough! or Too much.</p>

<p>The ancient poets animated all sensible
objects with Gods or Geniuses,
calling them by the names and adorning
them with properties of woods,
rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations,
and whatever their enlarged
and numerous senses could perceive.
And particularly they studied the
Genius of each city and country,
placing it under its mental deity. Till
a system was formed, which some
took advantage of and enslaved the
vulgar by attempting to realize or
abstract the mental deities from their
objects. Thus began Priesthood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Choosing forms of worship from
poetic tales. And at length they pronounced
that the Gods had ordered
such things. Thus men forgot that
all deities reside in the human breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_2" id="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_2"></a>A MEMORABLE FANCY</h2>


<p>The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel
dined with me, and I asked them how
they dared so roundly to assert that
God spoke to them, and whether they
did not think at the time that they
would be misunderstood, and so be
the cause of imposition.</p>

<p>Isaiah answered: &ldquo;I saw no God,
nor heard any, in a finite organical
perception: but my senses discovered
the infinite in everything; and as I
was then persuaded, and remained
confirmed, that the voice of honest
indignation is the voice of God, I cared
not for consequences, but wrote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I asked: &ldquo;Does a firm persuasion
that a thing is so, make it
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He replied: &ldquo;All poets believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
it does, and in ages of imagination
this firm persuasion removed mountains;
but many are not capable of a
firm persuasion of anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ezekiel said: &ldquo;The philosophy
of the East taught the first principles
of human perception; some nations
held one principle for the origin, and
some another. We of Israel taught
that the Poetic Genius (as you now
call it) was the first principle, and all
the others merely derivative, which
was the cause of our despising the
Priests and Philosophers of other
countries, and prophesying that all
Gods would at last be proved to originate
in ours, and to be the tributaries
of the Poetic Genius. It was this that
our great poet King David desired so
fervently, and invokes so pathetically,
saying by this he conquers enemies
and governs kingdoms; and we so
loved our God that we cursed in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
name all the deities of surrounding
nations, and asserted that they had
rebelled. From these opinions the
vulgar came to think that all nations
would at last be subject to the Jews.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;like all firm persuasions,
is come to pass, for all
nations believe the Jews&rsquo; code, and
worship the Jews&rsquo; God; and what
greater subjection can be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard this with some wonder, and
must confess my own conviction.
After dinner I asked Isaiah to favour
the world with his lost works; he said
none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel
said the same of his.</p>

<p>I also asked Isaiah what made him
go naked and barefoot three years.
He answered: &ldquo;The same that made
our friend Diogenes the Grecian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then asked Ezekiel why he ate
dung, and lay so long on his right and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
left side. He answered: &ldquo;The desire
of raising other men into a perception
of the infinite. This the North American
tribes practise. And is he honest
who resists his genius or conscience,
only for the sake of present ease or
gratification?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The ancient tradition that the world
will be consumed in fire at the end of
six thousand years is true, as I have
heard from Hell.</p>

<p>For the cherub with his flaming
sword is hereby commanded to leave
his guard at [the] tree of life, and
when he does, the whole creation will
be consumed and appear infinite and
holy, whereas it now appears finite
and corrupt.</p>

<p>This will come to pass by an improvement
of sensual enjoyment.</p>

<p>But first the notion that man has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a body distinct from his soul is to be
expunged; this I shall do by printing
in the infernal method by corrosives,
which in Hell are salutary and medicinal,
melting apparent surfaces away,
and displaying the infinite which was
hid.</p>

<p>If the doors of perception were
cleansed everything would appear to
man as it is, infinite.</p>

<p>For man has closed himself up, till
he sees all things through narrow
chinks of his cavern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_3" id="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_3"></a>A MEMORABLE FANCY</h2>


<p>I was in a printing-house in Hell,
and saw the method in which knowledge
is transmitted from generation
to generation.</p>

<p>In the first chamber was a dragon-man,
clearing away the rubbish from
a cave&rsquo;s mouth; within, a number of
dragons were hollowing the cave.</p>

<p>In the second chamber was a viper
folding round the rock and the cave,
and others adorning it with gold, silver,
and precious stones.</p>

<p>In the third chamber was an eagle
with wings and feathers of air; he
caused the inside of the cave to be
infinite; around were numbers of
eagle-like men, who built palaces in
the immense cliffs.</p>

<p>In the fourth chamber were lions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of flaming fire raging around and
melting the metals into living fluids.</p>

<p>In the fifth chamber were unnamed
forms, which cast the metals into the
expanse.</p>

<p>There they were received by men
who occupied the sixth chamber, and
took the forms of books, and were
arranged in libraries.</p>

<p>The Giants who formed this world
into its sensual existence and now
seem to live in it in chains are in
truth the causes of its life and the
sources of all activity, but the chains
are the cunning of weak and tame
minds, which have power to resist
energy, according to the proverb,
&ldquo;The weak in courage is strong in
cunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus one portion of being is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Prolific, the other the Devouring. To
the devourer it seems as if the producer
was in his chains; but it is not
so, he only takes portions of existence,
and fancies that the whole.</p>

<p>But the Prolific would cease to be
prolific unless the Devourer as a sea
received the excess of his delights.</p>

<p>Some will say, &ldquo;Is not God alone
the Prolific?&rdquo; I answer: &ldquo;God only
acts and is in existing beings or
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These two classes of men are always
upon earth, and they should be enemies:
whoever tries to reconcile them
seeks to destroy existence.</p>

<p>Religion is an endeavour to reconcile
the two.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Jesus Christ did not wish
to unite but to separate them, as in
the parable of sheep and goats; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He says: &ldquo;I came not to send peace,
but a sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Messiah, or Satan, or Tempter, was
formerly thought to be one of the
antediluvians who are our Energies.</p>

<h2><a name="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_4" id="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_4"></a>A MEMORABLE FANCY</h2>


<p>An Angel came to me and said: &ldquo;O
pitiable foolish young man! O horrible,
O dreadful state! Consider the
hot burning dungeon thou art preparing
for thyself to all Eternity, to which
thou art going in such career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said: &ldquo;Perhaps you will be willing
to show me my eternal lot, and we
will contemplate together upon it, and
see whether your lot or mine is most
desirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took me through a stable, and
through a church, and down into the
church vault, at the end of which was
a mill; through the mill we went, and
came to a cave; down the winding
cavern we groped our tedious way,
till a void boundless as a nether sky
appeared beneath us, and we held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the roots of trees, and hung over this
immensity; but I said: &ldquo;If you please,
we will commit ourselves to this void,
and see whether Providence is here
also; if you will not, I will.&rdquo; But he
answered: &ldquo;Do not presume, O young
man; but as we here remain, behold
thy lot, which will soon appear when
the darkness passes away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I remained with him sitting in
the twisted root of an oak; he was
suspended in a fungus, which hung
with the head downward into the
deep.</p>

<p>By degrees we beheld the infinite
abyss, fiery as the smoke of a burning
city; beneath us at an immense distance
was the sun, black but shining;
round it were fiery tracks on which
revolved vast spiders, crawling after
their prey, which flew, or rather
swum, in the infinite deep, in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
terrific shapes of animals sprung from
corruption; and the air was full of
them, and seemed composed of them.
These are Devils, and are called powers
of the air. I now asked my companion
which was my eternal lot.
He said: &ldquo;Between the black and
white spiders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now, from between the black
and white spiders, a cloud and fire
burst and rolled through the deep,
blackening all beneath so that the
nether deep grew black as a sea, and
rolled with a terrible noise. Beneath
us was nothing now to be seen but a
black tempest, till looking East between
the clouds and the waves, we
saw a cataract of blood mixed with
fire, and not many stones&rsquo; throw from
us appeared and sunk again the scaly
fold of a monstrous serpent. At last
to the East, distant about three degrees,
appeared a fiery crest above the waves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slowly it reared like a ridge of golden
rocks, till we discovered two globes
of crimson fire, from which the sea
fled away in clouds of smoke; and
now we saw it was the head of Leviathan.
His forehead was divided
into streaks of green and purple, like
those on a tiger&rsquo;s forehead; soon we
saw his mouth and red gills hang just
above the raging foam, tinging the
black deeps with beams of blood, advancing
toward us with all the fury
of a spiritual existence.</p>

<p>My friend the Angel climbed up
from his station into the mill. I
remained alone, and then this appearance
was no more; but I found
myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside
a river by moonlight, hearing a harper
who sung to the harp; and his theme
was: &ldquo;The man who never alters his
opinion is like standing water, and
breeds reptiles of the mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>But I arose, and sought for the
mill, and there I found my Angel,
who, surprised, asked me how I
escaped.</p>

<p>I answered: &ldquo;All that we saw was
owing to your metaphysics; for when
you ran away, I found myself on a
bank by moonlight, hearing a harper.
But now we have seen my eternal
lot, shall I show you yours?&rdquo; He
laughed at my proposal; but I by
force suddenly caught him in my
arms, and flew Westerly through the
night, till we were elevated above the
earth&rsquo;s shadow; then I flung myself
with him directly into the body of the
sun; here I clothed myself in white,
and taking in my hand Swedenborg&rsquo;s
volumes, sunk from the glorious clime,
and passed all the planets till we came
to Saturn. Here I stayed to rest, and
then leaped into the void between
Saturn and the fixed stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is your lot; in this
space, if space it may be called.&rdquo;
Soon we saw the stable and the church,
and I took him to the altar and opened
the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit,
into which I descended, driving the
Angel before me. Soon we saw seven
houses of brick. One we entered. In
it were a number of monkeys, baboons,
and all of that species, chained by the
middle, grinning and snatching at one
another, but withheld by the shortness
of their chains. However, I saw that
they sometimes grew numerous, and
then the weak were caught by the
strong, and with a grinning aspect,
first coupled with and then devoured
by plucking off first one limb and then
another till the body was left a helpless
trunk; this, after grinning and
kissing it with seeming fondness, they
devoured too. And here and there I
saw one savourily picking the flesh off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his own tail. As the stench terribly
annoyed us both, we went into the
mill; and I in my hand brought the
skeleton of a body, which in the mill
was Aristotle&rsquo;s Analytics.</p>

<p>So the Angel said: &ldquo;Thy phantasy
has imposed upon me, and thou oughtest
to be ashamed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered: &ldquo;We impose on one
another, and it is but lost time to converse
with you whose works are only
Analytics.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/tb.png" width="20" height="21" alt="*  *  *" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I have always found that Angels
have the vanity to speak of themselves
as the only wise; this they do
with a confident insolence sprouting
from systematic reasoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus Swedenborg boasts that what
he writes is new; though it is only the
contents or index of already published
books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A man carried a monkey about
for a show, and because he was a little
wiser than the monkey, grew vain,
and conceived himself as much wiser
than seven men. It is so with
Swedenborg; he shows the folly of
churches, and exposes hypocrites, till
he imagines that all are religious, and
himself the single one on earth that
ever broke a net.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg
has not written one new truth.
Now hear another: he has written all
the old falsehoods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now hear the reason: he conversed
with Angels who are all religious,
and conversed not with Devils
who all hate religion, for he was
incapable through his conceited notions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus Swedenborg&rsquo;s writings are
a recapitulation of all superficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
opinions, and an analysis of the more
sublime, but no further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have now another plain fact: any
man of mechanical talents may from
the writings of Paracelsus or Jacob
Behmen produce ten thousand volumes
of equal value with Swedenborg&rsquo;s, and
from those of Dante or Shakespeare an
infinite number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when he has done this, let
him not say that he knows better than
his master, for he only holds a candle
in sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_5" id="A_MEMORABLE_FANCY_5"></a>A MEMORABLE FANCY</h2>


<p>Once I saw a Devil in a flame of
fire, who arose before an Angel that
sat on a cloud, and the Devil uttered
these words: &ldquo;The worship of God is,
honouring His gifts in other men each
according to his genius, and loving
the greatest men best. Those who
envy or calumniate great men hate
God, for there is no other God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Angel hearing this became
almost blue, but mastering himself he
grew yellow, and at last white-pink
and smiling, and then replied: &ldquo;Thou
idolater, is not God One? and is not
He visible in Jesus Christ? and has
not Jesus Christ given His sanction to
the law of ten commandments? and
are not all other men fools, sinners,
and nothings?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The Devil answered: &ldquo;Bray a fool
in a mortar with wheat, yet shall not
his folly be beaten out of him. If
Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you
ought to love Him in the greatest
degree. Now hear how He has given
His sanction to the law of ten commandments.
Did He not mock at the
Sabbath, and so mock the Sabbath&rsquo;s
God? murder those who were murdered
because of Him? turn away the
law from the woman taken in adultery,
steal the labour of others to support
Him? bear false witness when He
omitted making a defence before
Pilate? covet when He prayed for His
disciples, and when He bid them
shake off the dust of their feet against
such as refused to lodge them? I tell
you, no virtue can exist without breaking
these ten commandments. Jesus
was all virtue, and acted from impulse,
not from rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had so spoken, I beheld
the Angel, who stretched out his arms
embracing the flame of fire, and he
was consumed, and arose as Elijah.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;This Angel, who is now
become a Devil, is my particular
friend; we often read the Bible together
in its infernal or diabolical
sense, which the world shall have if
they behave well.</p>

<p>I have also the Bible of Hell, which
the world shall have whether they
will or no.</p>

<p>One law for the lion and ox is Oppression.</p>

<p>1. The Eternal Female groan&rsquo;d; it
was heard over all the earth:</p>

<p>2. Albion&rsquo;s coast is sick silent; the
American meadows faint.</p>

<p>3. Shadows of prophecy shiver
along by the lakes and the rivers, and
mutter across the ocean. France,
rend down thy dungeon!</p>

of old Rome!</p>

<p>5. Cast thy keys, O Rome, into
the deep&mdash;down falling, even to
eternity down falling;</p>

<p>6. And weep!</p>

<p>7. In her trembling hands she took
the new-born terror, howling.</p>

<p>8. On those infinite mountains
of light now barr&rsquo;d out by the Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sea, the new-born fire stood before the
starry king.</p>

<p>9. Flagg&rsquo;d with grey-brow&rsquo;d snows
and thunderous visages, the jealous
wings wav&rsquo;d over the deep.</p>

<p>10. The speary hand burn&rsquo;d aloft;
unbuckled was the shield; forth went
the hand of jealousy among the flaming
hair, and hurl&rsquo;d the new-born
wonder through the starry night.</p>

<p>11. The fire, the fire is falling!</p>

<p>12. Look up! look up! O citizen
of London, enlarge thy countenance!
O Jew, leave counting gold; return to
thy oil and wine! O African, black
African! (Go, winged thought, widen
his forehead.)</p>

<p>13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair
shot like the sinking sun into the
Western sea.</p>

<p>14. Wak&rsquo;d from his eternal sleep,
the hoary element roaring fled away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>15. Down rush&rsquo;d, beating his wings
in vain, the jealous king, his grey-brow&rsquo;d
councillors, thunderous warriors,
curl&rsquo;d veterans, among helms
and shields, and chariots, horses, elephants,
banners, castles, slings, and
rocks.</p>

<p>16. Falling, rushing, ruining;
buried in the ruins, on Urthona&rsquo;s
dens.</p>

<p>17. All night beneath the ruins;
then their sullen flames, faded, emerge
round the gloomy king.</p>

<p>18. With thunder and fire, leading
his starry hosts through the waste
wilderness, he promulgates his ten
commandments, glancing his beamy
eyelids over the deep in dark dismay.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
